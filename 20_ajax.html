<!-- modern browsers have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object to request data from a server.
The XMLHttpRequest Object

The XMLHttpRequest object is a developers dream because you can:

Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server  - after the page has loaded

The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

The onreadystatechange event is triggered every time the readyState changes.

During a server request, the readyState changes from 0 to 4:

0: request not initialized 
1: server connection established
2: request received 
3: processing request 
4: request finished and response is ready

In the onreadystatechange property, specify a function to be executed when the readyState changes: -->
